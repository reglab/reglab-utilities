1. get the basicjup.sh script, either by itself or by having cloned this repo
2. chmod +x basicjup.sh
3. either run it using the path, eg. './basicjup.sh' from the folder it's in, or for convenience of just calling it from anywhere as just 'basicjup', you probably want to add something like this to your ~/.bashrc, using whatever the path of the basicjup.sh file is for you:
alias basicjup='~/reglab-utilities/shell_tools/basicjup/basicjup.sh'

for basic help: basicjup --help

simplest usage: basicjup dir/where/you/want/jupyter/server/root/to/be
